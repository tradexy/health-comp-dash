# Problem Statement: Agentic AI for Personalized Healthcare Alert System

## Background:
A digital health company is building a Personal Health Monitoring System (PHMS) to proactively detect potential health risks using wearable IoT data, Electronic Health Records (EHR), and behavioral patterns. You have been hired to design the Agentic AI layer responsible for personalized real-time risk assessment and intervention for patients with chronic illnesses (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, heart disease).

## Core Objective:
Design and develop an Agentic AI-based Health Companion Agent (HCA) that observes user data streams in real-time and intelligently decides when and how to:
1. **Trigger health alerts,**
2. **Recommend behavioral or medical interventions,**
3. **Escalate to a care provider, or**
4. **Stay passive** and keep monitoring.

This agent must be **personalized per user, learn continuously, and align with ethical and medical safety constraints.**

## Functional Requirements:
### **Observation:**
    i. Ingest real-time data from wearables (heart rate, glucose, SpO2, sleep).
    ii. Access structured EHR data (medication history, allergies, diagnoses).
    iii. Analyze behavioral logs (diet, activity level, mood journals).
    iv. Store and process all data in MongoDB (timeseries + structured records).

### Goals:
   i. Prevent emergency events (e.g., stroke, hypoglycemia) by early detection.
   ii. Minimize false positives to avoid alert fatigue.
   iii. Personalize alert thresholds using continuous learning (PyTorch/TensorFlow).

### Agent Capabilities:
    i. Use past data, rules, and learned models to assess current risk.
    ii. Handle multi-modal signals using hybrid ML (rule-based + deep learning).
   iii. If anomaly is detected, initiate one of the following:
                a. **Mild alert:** Notify patient via app to take corrective action.
                b. **Escalation:** Alert assigned physician/caretaker.
                c. **No action:** Log and wait if risk is low or uncertain.
   iv. For model version tracking and retraining management, you can use MLFLOW
   v. Deploy in Azure using Azure MLOps pipelines for continuous learning and rollout.

## Tech Constraints:
1.  Feel free to use your technology stack.
2. All models should be logged and tracked, e.g. MLFLOW (parameters, artifacts, metrics).
3. Agent should support multi-modal learning, explanation generation, and human-in-the-loop override.
4. Must allow for customized thresholds per user, learned over time.

## Ethical Constraints:
1. Agent must be interpretable â€” users can request "**Why did I get this alert?**"
2. Ensure data privacy and secure access control.
3. Use bias detection methods to prevent medical disparities in recommendations.
4. Allow patients to opt-out of automatic escalation if legally permitted.
