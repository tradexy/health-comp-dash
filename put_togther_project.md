Top Level Executive Summary.
This project was created from a problem statement request.
The work has been carried out in 2 main parts. First the “Web App” and files are available to you in the  “personalized-healthcare-alert-system” folder and then a Machine Learning Part whose files are in the healthcare-ml-service folder.
All or most of the main requirements are done or nearly done.
It is now your job to put these 2 pieces of work together, so that they can run as one.
Once done then we will need to look for any main requirements that still need to be fulfilled.
However the most important part is to get these 2 parts communicating as they should.

We have created the information below to help you get this done.
Web App Summary:
The files for this are in the “personalized-healthcare-alert-system” folder.

The creation of this project comes from the original official Problem Statement which you can find in the personalized-healthcare-alert-system/problem_statement.md file.
We've developed a "Personalized Healthcare Alert System" with a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend that uses MongoDB for data persistence.
Frontend:
Displays current (simulated) vital signs (heart rate, glucose, SpO2, etc.).
Shows active alerts and insights based on user data and predefined rules.
Allows users to simulate new health data points with varying severity.
Provides a form for users to log behavioral data (diet, mood, activity).
Users can request AI-generated explanations for alerts.
Users can customize their health thresholds and other settings (like auto-escalation).
Includes a feed of recent health data, alerts, and behavioral logs.


Backend:
Receives health data points and behavioral logs from the frontend.
Stores user profiles, health data, and behavioral logs in a MongoDB database.
Performs risk assessment on new health data, considering user thresholds and recent behavioral context, to generate alerts.
Interfaces with the Gemini API to provide natural language explanations for alerts, incorporating user data and recent logs for context.
Manages initial seeding of user data in MongoDB.


Key Functionality:
Data Simulation & Monitoring: The app simulates health data, which is processed for risk.
Alerting System: Alerts (Info, Mild, Escalation) are generated by the backend based on incoming health data and user thresholds. The frontend also generates simple client-side "Insights".
AI Explanations: Users can get AI-powered explanations for alerts, generated by the backend using Gemini.
Behavioral Logging: Users can log diet, mood, and activity, which is stored and used by the backend for richer context in assessments and explanations.
Personalization: Users can set their own health thresholds and control alert escalation preferences.
Data Persistence: User data, health metrics, and behavioral logs are persisted in MongoDB via the backend.


Requirements Met (Summary based on 
You can see the content in the personalized-healthcare-alert-system/requirements_traceability.csv file.
Core Objectives (CO):
CO1 (Trigger Alerts): Done. The backend now primarily handles this.
CO2 (Recommend Actions): Partially Done. AI explanations (via backend) offer general advice based on context.
CO3 (Escalate Alerts): Done. Escalation level exists; backend handles logic considering user preference.
CO4 (Passive Monitoring): Done. No alerts if data is normal.
CO5 (Personalization): Partially Done. User thresholds, behavioral logs, and client-side insights contribute.
CO6 (Continuous Learning): Started. Basic client-side insights are a first step; backend doesn't yet "learn" thresholds.
CO7 (Ethical/Safety): Started. Alert explanations, opt-out for escalation.


Observation (FO):
FO1 (Wearable Data): Partially Done. Data is simulated.
FO2 (EHR Access): Partially Done. Basic EHR data is simulated and used by the backend.
FO3 (User Notes Analysis): Partially Done. Behavioral logs are captured, stored, and used by the backend for context.
FO4 (MongoDB Storage): Done. The backend now uses MongoDB for all primary data persistence.


Goals (FG):
FG1 (Prevent Emergencies): Partially Done. Backend alerts consider context, aiding early risk spotting.
FG2 (Minimize False Positives): Started. Alert dismissal feedback is present; backend assesses context.
FG3 (Smart Personalization): Started. Manual thresholds exist; client-side insights are a step towards adaptive analysis.


Agent Capabilities (AC):
AC1 (Risk Assessment): Partially Done. Backend uses rules, health data, and behavioral logs.
AC2 (Combine Data Types): Partially Done. Backend uses health metrics and behavioral logs.
AC3 (Mild Alerts): Done.
AC4 (Escalation Alerts): Done.
AC5 (Log & Wait): Done. Normal/Info events are logged.


Tech Constraints (TC):
TC2 (Multi-modal Input): Partially Done. Backend now uses health and behavioral data.
TC3 (Explain Alerts): Done. Backend provides AI explanations.
TC4 (Human Oversight): Started. User settings, alert dismissal.
TC5 (Customizable/Learned Thresholds): Partially Done. Customizable thresholds exist; "learned" part is via client-side insights.


Ethical Constraints (EC):
EC1 (Understandable Alerts): Done. Explanations available via backend.
EC4 (Opt-out Escalation): Done.



—-----------------------------------

The following Phase was covered by another developer and the files are in the healthcare-ml-service folder: AC6, AC7, TC1 (MLOps/model tracking), EC2 (full data privacy/security for a real system), EC3 (bias detection). These typically relate to more advanced ML model development, deployment, and production-grade security.




Project Integration Report: Health Companion Agent with Personalized Alert System

1. Project Overview
The Health Companion Agent (HCA) is a web application designed to monitor user health data, assess risks, and provide timely alerts. It simulates intelligent health monitoring with:
User health dashboards
Real-time alerting for abnormal health metrics
Behavioral logging (diet, mood, activity)
The Personalized Healthcare Alert System (ML Service) adds adaptive intelligence to HCA by:
Personalizing alert thresholds based on user history
Learning from user feedback to reduce false alarms
Continuously improving via MLOps practices

2. ML Service Implementation Details
Repository: healthcare-ml-service
Core Components:
healthcare-ml-service/
├── app/                  # API service and ML logic
├── training/             # Model training scripts
├── docker/               # Containerization
├── infrastructure/       # Azure deployment scripts
└── generate_data.py      # Synthetic data generator


Key Features:
Threshold Prediction:
Uses historical health data + behavioral logs
Predicts personalized thresholds for glucose/heart rate
MLOps Integration:

docker/Dockerfile: Container build instructions
infrastructure/deploy_azure.sh: Azure deployment script

3. Integration Points with HCA
Integration Steps:
Node.js Backend Modifications:
Add API call to ML service when reviewing user thresholds
Example (in server/services/thresholdService.js):
const fetchThresholds = async (userId, metric) => {
  const response = await axios.get(
    'http://ml-service:8000/ml/personalized_thresholds',
    { params: { userId, metric } }
  );
  return response.data;
};
2. Threshold Update Workflow:
Call ML service weekly for each user
Update MongoDB users collection:
await db.collection('users').updateOne(
  { id: userId },
  { $set: { 
    'thresholds.GLUCOSE': newThresholds,
    'lastThresholdAdjustment': new Date() 
  }}
);


4. Local Testing Workflow
Start All Services:
# Terminal 1: Start MongoDB
docker-compose up -d


# Terminal 2: Start MLflow tracking server
mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db --default-artifact-root ./artifacts --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5008


# Terminal 3: Build and run ML service
docker build -t health-ml-service -f docker/Dockerfile .
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env health-ml-service


# Terminal 4: Start Node.js backend
cd server && npm run dev


# Terminal 5: Start React frontend
npm run dev


Verification Test:
curl "http://localhost:8000/ml/personalized_thresholds?userId=user-001&metric=GLUCOSE"
# Expected: {"suggestedThresholds": {"low":70, "high":180}, ...}


5. Azure Deployment Preparation
Critical Scripts:
infrastructure/deploy_azure.sh: Creates:
Azure ML Workspace
Container Registry
AKS Cluster
Deployment Steps:
Build MLflow Environment:
az ml environment create -f infrastructure/mlflow-environment.yml
